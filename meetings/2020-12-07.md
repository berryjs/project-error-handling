    - possibility of updating the object-provider API to possibly allow
    extracting context which includes lifetimes
      - on implemented version uses marker types which implement a trait with
      an associated type to provide a static type to downcast to as a proxy for
      a type which cannot have a type id because it contains lifetimes
